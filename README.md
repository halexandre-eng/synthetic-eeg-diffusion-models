## Overview

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used, non-invasive method for capturing brain activity, especially relevant in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. However, collecting high-quality EEG data is challenging due to sensor costs, acquisition time, and inter-subject variability. This project presents a methodology for generating synthetic EEG signals related to motor imagery tasks using Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).

The approach comprises preprocessing real EEG data, training a diffusion model to reconstruct EEG channels from noise, and evaluating the quality of the generated signals using both signal-level and task-level metrics. For validation, classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and U-Net were employed to compare the classification performance of synthetic versus real data. The generated synthetic EEG signals achieved classification accuracies above 95%, with low mean squared error and high correlation with real signals.

The results demonstrate that synthetic EEG signals generated by diffusion models can effectively complement datasets, improve classification performance in EEG-based BCIs, and address the problem of data scarcity.
